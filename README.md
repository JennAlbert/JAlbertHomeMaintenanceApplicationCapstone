To start clone https://github.com/JennAlbert/JAlbertHomeMaintenanceApplicationCapstone.git

This is a Blazor Application. Open with Visual Studio and click Run. The application will open on a page that explains it is for Household Maintenance (chores). Also on Assign Chore Buddy 
is code that will connect to the existing UserChoreDB.db SQLite database I created within the application. I wanted to move this to a class and display the data on another page in a table.

Assign Chore Buddy calls the PokeAPI and brings in the ID and Name for 1-252. There is a folder in the application with the images corresponding to these numbers. Unfortunately I 
could not figure out how to display the image in the application based on the Id number but going forward I would like to. 

Chore Form will eventually allow the user to INSERT INTO the existing UserChoreDB.db in the application when the user clicks Submit. For now, the Submit button will not do anything. 

Household Maintenance List will display a hardcoded list to a table under Additional Tasks for the Home. Eventually I would like Home Maintenace Task List to be able to display
data from the UserChoreDB.db in a table like the hardcoded list but I could not figure out how. 

I tried very hard on this application and learned a lot from the mentors but this is so far from what I want it to be. This experience taught me I was not ready to make a web 
application yet. I am still very much a beginner. Hopefully I can come back to this when I know more and have it function the way I envision.
